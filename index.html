      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>Our projects are designed to widen participation, increase educational and employment opportunities for people with disabilities through the use of Assistive Technology. Alongside with community workers in different areas of Rwanda, RATA intervenes in 4 areas which are: “Raising Awareness and Advocacy on the use and importance of Assistive technology, Capacity development, Inclusive education and Innovation.”</p>

        <img src="img/comm.png" />
        <h3>Community Outreach and Public Awareness</h3>
        <p>RATA intervenes in this area as many people in Rwanda are not yet aware enough of the importance of Assistive Technology in the lives of persons with disabilities. It’s done through meetings, workshops, awareness campaigns and consultations among private and public institutions, schools and the general community. RATA also plans to use innovative and various channels to pass appropriate messages during awareness and advocacy campaigns. In February 2024, Accessible free online courses on Assistive Technology were introduced on our website, to primarily make sure many people in Rwanda are aware enough of the importance of Assistive Technology in the lives of persons with disabilities.

        <h3>Capacity Development and Facilitating Access to Assistive Technologies</h3>
        <p>Public and private institutions, schools, persons with disabilities, their caretakers and parents should be equipped with skills and knowledge on Assistive Technology in order to widen participation, increase educational and employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. The high cost of Assistive Technologies and their availability is another challenge that RATA tackles on.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="img/train.png" />
        <h3>Training of Trainers (TOT) in Education</h3>
        <p>To enhance Inclusive education, Assistive Technology plays a great role as it provides special educational needs software, switches, computer access devices, communication aids for learners with disabilities. Teachers and other professionals involved in supporting children with disabilities should be equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills on Assistive Technology in order to ensure that the classroom is inclusive. Under the project called: “Accessible digital content for persons with disabilities”, RATA is training teachers in inclusive and special schools on how to prepare accessible digital content for their students.</p>

        <h3>Inclusive Tech Lab</h3>
        <p>Under our Inclusive Tech Lab, we have an inclusive educational platform for technology designed for persons with disabilities and a resource centre for Assistive Technology. The lab also serves as a platform where persons with disabilities grow in tech while learning, collaborating, connecting and innovating their local and affordable Assistive Technologies that meet their needs.</p>

        <h3>Digital Accessibility and Innovation</h3>
        <p>This is the area where we believe AT can make a great impact in improving the lives of persons with disabilities. Local AT tools need to be created.</p>

        <p>"I'm very grateful for the skills I gained during RATA training. As a language teacher, I learned how to make comprehension texts more accessible for my students by turning them into audio recordings. Additionally, I also developed skills on how to confidently create school materials and resources that students with visual impairments will find easy to use."

        <p>"As a resource room facilitator at University of Rwanda-Nyagatare Campus, I often faced challenges while facilitating students with disabilities like how to make accessible documents, using braille displays, victor readers, braille embossers,... but after attending RATA training on Assistive Technology, I am now able to overcome such challenges."</p>
